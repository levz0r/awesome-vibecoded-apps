# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Awesome Vibecoded Apps!

## What Belongs Here

This list is for **apps and projects that were built using vibe coding** - AI-assisted development where you collaborated with tools like Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, or similar AI coding assistants.

### Requirements

Your submission should:

- Be a working, publicly available project (open source preferred, but not required)
- Have been substantially built using AI assistance (vibe coding)
- Have a clear description of what it does
- Be something you built or have permission to submit

### What We're NOT Looking For

- AI coding tools themselves (those belong in [awesome-vibe-coding](https://github.com/filipecalegario/awesome-vibe-coding))
- Projects that only used AI for minor fixes or documentation
- Abandoned or broken projects
- Duplicate entries
